oxc-css is a parser which can parse CSS, SCSS, Sass (indented syntax) and Less. However, it won't compile SCSS, Sass or Less to CSS.

## 🧪 Playground

There is an online playground for inspecting AST. Visit: [https://raffia-play.vercel.app/](https://raffia-play.vercel.app/).

## 🍭 Example

```rust
use oxc_css::{ast::Stylesheet, Parser, Syntax};

let mut parser = Parser::new("a { color: green }", Syntax::Css);
let ast = parser.parse::<Stylesheet>().unwrap();
println!("{:#?}", ast);
```

You can find more examples in the [examples](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc-css/blob/main/crates/oxc_css/examples) directory.

For detailed usage, check out [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/oxc-css).

## ⌛ Benchmark

You can compare performance with other parsers in benchmark.

First, you need to setup Rust and clone this repository. You also need to install `cargo-criterion` by running `cargo install cargo-criterion`.

Then, copy some CSS files to `bench_data` directory. You need to create that directory by yourself.

Now you can run benchmark by running `cargo criterion`.
